Match each card with his pair, you don't have limited time to do it but once you start the time start to run too!!!

At the end of the game you will have your stats.

Star system made to enhance the good players:
	3 Stars - Perfect
	2 Stars - Good job!
	1 Star - You need to improve

## Technical

I used CSS3, HTML5 and Javascript as technologies used.

### Dependencies

Css 	-> 		Styling of the game
JS 		-> 		The scripts who makes the game run.
Index 	-> 		The model of the page
